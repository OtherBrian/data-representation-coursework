Shopify API requirements

Authorization - https://shopify.dev/apps/auth#types-of-authentication

HTTP Authentication


Private apps can authenticate through basic HTTP authentication by using their Admin API key and password as a username and password. You can generate these credentials from the Shopify admin of the store that you want to connect with your app.

Public and custom apps can authenticate using a custom HTTP request header, which is used for informational or troubleshooting purposes. You must include the request header X-Shopify-Access-Token: {access_token}, where {access_token} is replaced by your private appâ€™s password. Shopify provides several API libraries that can help you implement this specification.

Orders api - https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/2021-10/resources/order#top

"Create a comprehensive order" might be what I want here. 

Order ID is included in the response. Can I automatically grab this and do the GET straight away?
