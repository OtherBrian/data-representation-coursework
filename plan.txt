Plan:
* Database tables:
    * Customers
    * Products
    * Orders
        * Orders should refer to customers and products (i.e. who ordered what)
* Webpage does GET calls to database via app to get products.
* Customer enters their details, webpage does PUSH to database via app to add the customer.
    * Cutomer can then login and edit their details via PUT
* Webpage does GET to get the customer information back. 
* When customer wishes to make an order, they specify products and customer. This then does a PUSH to Shopify to create the order.
* App then does GET on the order, and PUSHes it to the database.
* Webpage does a GET to show the order details.
